# A landing will be here...

## *But for now this page will be used for testing*

This is just a test paragraph. I will make this file incredibly long, just for the hell of it.
The paragraph is a oneliner, however, if I add <br/> It will be 2. And the best practice for
bold text is **This one**. Also, for the demo, I'll add *italic* too.

> Doesn't it?

### Code

Okay, open the file and find this:

### Images

Let's move on to some serious cyber-security stuff. Look! An image of serious hacker:

Has it rendered?

##### Linking Images

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

# HTML

Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.

To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file.

This **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic.
